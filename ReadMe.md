 I. Data - Shows all CSV Files used in this notebook.
 
 II. Indicies - Shows all The data Frame CSV files Used for the plots in the Plots folder, 
     these were created in the M2-Stock-Corr code.
      
 III. Plots Shows the Code to plot all the data created in the M2-Stock-Corr code.
 
 IV. Get_Data - Shows Code to get historical data from binance api, and clean it for functionality purposes.
 
 V.Crypto Plots & Strategy coding, labeled respectively

## The Process & Stages involved.
### - Analysing Index Data

  1. Download Index Data From Yahoo Finance
  2. Normalize Data to common denominator ($USD)
  3. Calculate percentage Change in Index's
  4. Download M2 Data
  5. Normalize Stock Data to Account for M2 Debasement
  6. Calculate Global Market returns
  7. Calculate Global Market returns accounting for Debasement
  8. Save new dataframes as CSV Files
  9. Plot new dataframes in Seperate Code
  10. Screenshot Plots for Presentation

### - Analysing Historical Crypto Data
  
   1. Create code to hook into binance API and download Historical data
   2. Clean data and save to csv file for future use
   3. load csv files into seperate coding file
   4. Test different trading strategies.
   5. ultimately, create a class that does the following:
     
     I. Gets data
     II. Prepares data
     III. Runs backtests on the strategy
     IV. Plots results
     V. Prints results
     
    6. Use the class to test different strategies
    7. Use the class to test on different crypto assets
    8. Use seperate page to impliment the strategy in to a plot for visualization
    9. Plot the strategies and screenshot for presenting.
